### levercast-product-management.md
```I want to create a high-conversion landing page for a company called Levercast details of which are attached in the document. And I'd like to add a call to action for a sign-up to a waitlist for the product because it hasn't launched yet.```

### email
```
On the landing page, l'd like to connect the CTA and the ymail inbox so that it gets sent to a certain email address. We're going to use Resend in order to do this, and I've already put the API key for Resend into the env file. Can you go and search the web, get the best practice for integrating these two, and let's go ahead and do that. @web
```
### env
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
RESEND_RECEIVER_EMAIL=your-inbox@ymail.com
